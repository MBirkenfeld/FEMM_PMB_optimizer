This Script allow for easy Calculation and Optimization Permanent Magnetic Bearings (PMBs)

How to use:

1. Install FEMM
2. If you wish to take use the provided NdFeB-Materials, replace "matlib.dat" from your FEMM-directory in your FEMM install directory with the file from this repository.
3. right click on folder "Calculate and Optimize Magnetic Bearings with FEMM" and click "add to path/selected folders and subfolers"
4. open Main/example.m for quick overview


For optimization, it is advised that you have a lincense for the Mathworks Parallel Computing Toolbox.
